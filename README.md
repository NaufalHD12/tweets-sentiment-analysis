| Dataset | [Sentiment Analysis Dataset - Binary Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dineshpiyasamara/sentiment-analysis-dataset) |
| Problem Description | The primary problem addressed in this project is the classification of tweets into binary sentiment categories, typically positive or negative. This involves analyzing the text of tweets to determine the underlying sentiment expressed. |
| Machine Learning Solution | The solution involves building a machine learning pipeline that processes the input tweet data, applies data transformations, trains a model, and evaluates its performance. The pipeline is designed to automate the stages of data ingestion, validation, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.|
| Data Processing Method | The data processing method uses TensorFlow Extended (TFX) components. The pipeline includes stages for data ingestion with **CsvExampleGen**, statistics generation with **StatisticsGen**, schema generation with **SchemaGen**, anomaly detection with **ExampleValidator**, and data transformation with **Transform**. |
| Model Architecture | The model architecture is a binary classification model built using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes a text vectorization layer, an embedding layer, global average pooling, dropout layers, and dense layers. The model is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. The **Trainer** component orchestrates the training process, utilizing this architecture to fit the model to the training data, and manages the training loop, callbacks, and evaluation on validation data. The **Resolver** component helps manage model versions by identifying the latest blessed model, allowing for effective comparison and selection of the best-performing model for deployment.|
| Evaluation Metrics | The evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance include AUC (Area Under the Curve), binary accuracy, false positives, true positives, false negatives, and true negatives. The **Evaluator** component uses these metrics to assess the model's performance systematically. It also applies thresholds to ensure that improvements in metrics like binary accuracy are significant.|
| Model Performance | The model achieved a high AUC of 0.94, indicating strong discrimination between positive and negative sentiments. The binary accuracy was 0.89, reflecting good overall performance. There were 72 false negatives and 99 false positives, suggesting areas for potential improvement in reducing these errors. |
